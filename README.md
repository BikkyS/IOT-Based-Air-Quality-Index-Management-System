# IOT-Based-Air-Quality-Index-Management-System
Device that can measure different gases parameters present in the air using different sensors and IOT.
Internet of Things (IOT) may be a world-wide system of “smart devices” which will sense and
connect with their surroundings and interact with users and other systems. Global air pollution is
one of the major concerns of our era. The level of pollution has increased with times by lot of
things like the increase in population, increased vehicle use, industrialization and urbanization
which ends up in harmful effects on human wellbeing by directly affecting health of population
exposed to it. Air quality goes down when enough amount of harmful gases present in the air like
carbon dioxide, smoke, alcohol, benzene, NH3, and NO2.In order to analyses we are developing
an IOT Based pollution Monitoring System which we'll monitor the Air Quality over an internet
server. Existing monitoring systems have inferior precision, low sensitivity, and need laboratory
analysis. Therefore, improved monitoring systems are needed. To overcome the issues of
existing systems, we propose this small circuit board helps AQI monitoring through an
interactive dashboard showing data of ozone, CO2, temperature and humidity.
