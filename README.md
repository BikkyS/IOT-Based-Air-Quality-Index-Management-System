# IOT-Based-Air-Quality-Index-Management-System
Internet of Things (IOT) may be a world-wide system of “smart devices” which will sense and
connect with their surroundings and interact with users and other systems. Global air pollution is
one of the major concerns of our era. The level of pollution has increased with times by lot of
things like the increase in population, increased vehicle use, industrialization and urbanization
which ends up in harmful effects on human wellbeing by directly affecting health of population
exposed to it. Air quality goes down when enough amount of harmful gases present in the air like
carbon dioxide, Architectural design is a discipline that focuses on covering and meeting the needs and
demands, to create living spaces, using certain tools and especially, creativity. Therefore, the
aim is to combine the technological and the aesthetic, despite the general belief that
architecture is only a technological task.
Below architecture describes the complete architecture of our project. It consists of
NodeMCU wifi module, co2 sensor MG811, ozone sensor MQ131, LCD Display, arduino
board, temperature and humidity sensor DHT22, ThinkSpeak IOT cloud, User Interface (UI)
and power supply. All the sensors co2 sensor, ozone sensor & DHT22 sensor are connected
to the node mcu wifi module to send the sensed data to the ThingSpeak Iot cloud. These
data‟s are displayed on I2C display. Same data‟s is displayed on UI design also accessed via
ThingSpeak. Power supply is given to the arduino and node mcu. Therefore, this simplified
diagram gives the completed idea of architecture of the project in a simplified way such that
it can be understand easily.smoke, alcohol, benzene, NH3, and NO2.In order to analyses we are developing
an IOT Based pollution Monitoring System which we'll monitor the Air Quality over an internet
server. Existing monitoring systems have inferior precision, low sensitivity, and need laboratory
analysis. Therefore, improved monitoring systems are needed. To overcome the issues of
existing systems, we propose this small circuit board helps AQI monitoring through an
interactive dashboard showing data of ozone, CO2, temperature and humidity.

1. Objective of the Project
The main objective of this project is to develop a device that can measures temperature,
humidity, carbon dioxide and ozone gas concentration at that particular place wherever that
device is placed. Those observed values is visible to everyone on a LCD display connected to
the device as well as on the user interface (UI) designed by using html, css and JavaScript.
Data is visible in graphical as well as discrete digital value. Instant data as well as 10 days
before data‟s can be observed in the graph on UI.
Those observed values will help the environmental analyst to analyse the environmental air
gases parameters along with the ozone concentration. Analysing of these data‟s will clarify
the clear blue print for “What Measures should be taken and where first?” to maintain the
greater concentration of ozone and controlling of harmful gases like carbon dioxide (co2).
The main innovative in our project is to measure ozone concentration as well along with the
other pollutant gases which was not there in the existing project.

3.Circuit Design
A circuit diagram (wiring diagram, electrical diagram, elementary diagram, electronic
schematic) is a graphical representation of an electrical circuit. A pictorial circuit diagram
uses simple images of components, while a schematic diagram shows the components and
interconnections of the circuit using standardized symbolic representations. The presentation
of the interconnections between circuit components in the schematic diagram does not
necessarily correspond to the physical arrangements in the finished device.
Unlike a block diagram or layout diagram, a circuit diagram shows the actual electrical
connections. A drawing meant to depict the physical arrangement of the wires and the components they connect is called artwork or layout, physical design or wiring diagram.
Circuit diagrams are used for the design (circuit design), construction (such as PCB layout),
and maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment.

4. Flow Diagram
A flowchart is a picture of the separate steps of a process in sequential order. It is a generic
tool that can be adapted for a wide variety of purposes, and can be used to describe various
processes, such as a manufacturing process, an administrative or service process, or a project
plan. A flowchart is a diagram depicting a process, a system or a computer algorithm. It is a
diagrammatic representation of the solution to a given problem but, more importantly, it
provides a breakdown of the essential steps to solving the problem. Flow diagram is a
collective term for a diagram representing a flow or set of dynamic relationships in a system.
The term flow diagram is also used as a synonym for flowchart, and sometimes as a
counterpart of the flowchart.
Flow diagrams are used to structure and order a complex system, or to reveal the underlying
structure of the elements and their interactions. Below Flow diagram describes the complete
data flow from starting phase to ending phase of our project.
