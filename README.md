# IOT-Based-Air-Quality-Index-Management-System
Internet of Things (IOT) may be a world-wide system of “smart devices” which will sense and
connect with their surroundings and interact with users and other systems. Global air pollution is
one of the major concerns of our era. The level of pollution has increased with times by lot of
things like the increase in population, increased vehicle use, industrialization and urbanization
which ends up in harmful effects on human wellbeing by directly affecting health of population
exposed to it. Air quality goes down when enough amount of harmful gases present in the air like
carbon dioxide, smoke, alcohol, benzene, NH3, and NO2.In order to analyses we are developing
an IOT Based pollution Monitoring System which we'll monitor the Air Quality over an internet
server. Existing monitoring systems have inferior precision, low sensitivity, and need laboratory
analysis. Therefore, improved monitoring systems are needed. To overcome the issues of
existing systems, we propose this small circuit board helps AQI monitoring through an
interactive dashboard showing data of ozone, CO2, temperature and humidity.

1. Objective of the Project
The main objective of this project is to develop a device that can measures temperature,
humidity, carbon dioxide and ozone gas concentration at that particular place wherever that
device is placed. Those observed values is visible to everyone on a LCD display connected to
the device as well as on the user interface (UI) designed by using html, css and JavaScript.
Data is visible in graphical as well as discrete digital value. Instant data as well as 10 days
before data‟s can be observed in the graph on UI.
Those observed values will help the environmental analyst to analyse the environmental air
gases parameters along with the ozone concentration. Analysing of these data‟s will clarify
the clear blue print for “What Measures should be taken and where first?” to maintain the
greater concentration of ozone and controlling of harmful gases like carbon dioxide (co2).
The main innovative in our project is to measure ozone concentration as well along with the
other pollutant gases which was not there in the existing project.
